        ` is studying CS in EU and have been struggling to find an internship for more than a yea` +
        `r now. And that has affected me and the people around me so much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt` +
        `;I am at a very bad place right now. I am only getting up to study for my exams and go t` +
        `o classes because, I know I would be majorly fucked up if I didn’t and I do have dreams ` +
        `and hope for my master. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do apply to a few jobs everyday, email ` +
        `people, but have gotten 2 interviews so far and have been rejected. I don’t know what to` +
        ` do, how to improve myself. I am so lost. Everyone at Uni is moving forward, I don’t kno` +
        `w how, they’re the people I hang out with at uni, they just don’t tell me things. &lt;/p` +
        `&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a good GPA, it’s almost straight As. That doesn’t help, there’s ` +
        `always better candidates and profiles. I have been ignored, ghosted, rejected for a year` +
        `. Still continuing to do so. I have applied to tech roles and research roles yet nothing` +
        `. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped my contact with my family back home, they don’t under` +
        `stand. Every time we talk, they tell me that it will be fine, or I should have stayed ba` +
        `ck home, or joke about it. It is so draining. I am not okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My o` +
        `lder sister who was also a CS major, and has a job and lives in a more stable EU country` +
        ` has totally turned her back on me. It has been 4 months since we talked. And whenever I` +
        ` text, she’s super formal, almost like a stranger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a` +
        `ny really friends, people that I know outside unis are privileged people (not in cs). I ` +
        `can’t keep hearing about their love affairs when I am mentally and financially strugglin` +
        `g and don’t know who to talk with or go to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was such a great an` +
        `d ambitious kid. I don’t know why I turned into such a waste. I feel pathetic. I am so b` +
        `roken. I failed myself. I don’t know where to go. My time management sucks. Honestly I d` +
        `on’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up poor, I must escape the loop. I am` +
        ` scared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have even gone to a few places near my accommodation t` +
        `o ask for a normal job. They’re not hiring. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;`,
